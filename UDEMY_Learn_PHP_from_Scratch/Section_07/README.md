# php 5.4

It has become apparent that the course was written for php. 5.4.

I'm running php 8.0.12 and struggling to replicate these errors, though they are probably good practices, it seems php 8+ is a bit more forgiving than previous versions.

I'll be updating my skills with a more up to date course on php8 soon.
